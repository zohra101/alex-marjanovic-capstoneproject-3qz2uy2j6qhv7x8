        <p>
          Here's a sampling of current and past projects to which I've
          contributed.

        <p>
          Many projects involve propietary information or sensitive data. To
          protect the confidentiality and privacy of my clients and/or employers,
          most samples are generic representations of the deliverables produced.
          Any samples that contain actual work are from defunct companies with any
          data redacted.

      card1.description="I created this administrator's guide template for a previous employer. These guides were paired with a user guide for each application. Since I was also one of the software quality analysts, I outlined both guides after reviewing the application's business requirements and technical specifications, and developed the content while performing QA. After the final round of bug fixes, both guides were delivered to the user acceptance testing leads for UAT and ownership.";

Several team members, myself included, reported that the keyword searching in our tracking system wasn't robust. We also stored information in different file shares on network drives. I designed these storyboards to demonstrate how a centralized intranet site to store our policies and procuedures and a more robust searchable knowlesge base would improve both efficiency and end user (in this case, the employees) satisfaction, and also submitted it as my Master's project.";
